# Basic Algorithm Scripting by FreeCodeCamp

## Introduction
The algorithm exercises described here are practical training in [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/). I finished all these exercises using the course platform with Javascript, and this folder contains my resolutions of these algorithms in Go.
